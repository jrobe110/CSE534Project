This project was completed for CSE 534 Advanced Computer Networks by Jason Roberts and Easton Kelso.

To run the notebook go to 'Project(1).ipynb' and download all files into fabric. You will need to update path files for the '.upload' commands as the user's system might be differnet how we the owners used it.

The code within the notebook as been taken from Lab 1 of the P4 labs on FABRIC and heavily adjusted to fit the scope of the project, however the base is still the same.

All code had a base with the P4 labs provided on FABRIC but modified to fit our project.
